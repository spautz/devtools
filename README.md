Packagelint is a linter for the files that live _around_ your code. It's meant to complement traditional code linters
like ESLint.

Packagelint runs a series of validation rules -- defined in `.packagelint.js` -- against your project directory.
It's most useful when you have a group of projects that should all follow common standards, like having a `.npmrc`
file, certain `.npmrc` settings, particular config values for ESLint or Jest, or a certain version of React.

## At a Glance

- `.packagelint.js` sets options and errorLevels for the rules you want to run.
- You can create multiple copies of a rule by customizing its name. For example: the `@packagelint/core:nvmrc` rule can
  be configured once to require a `.nvmrc` file with NodeJS >= 10, at errorLevel "error", then again with NodeJS >= 14
  at errorLevel "suggestion".
- Reporters and exit code conditions may be customized to be strict or lenient.

## How it works

Under the hood, it's like a hybrid between ESLint and Jest: rules are configured as if they're for a linter, but
they're evaluated and reported as if they're automated tests.
